  <p>
    I'm a staff+ software engineer and solution architect experienced in wearing
    a leadership hat.
  </p>
  <p>
    My career spans various industries (such as banking, medtech, travel, and
    more), company sizes (ranging from startups to large enterprises), and
    countries (I am a former Londoner and Sydneysider, now settled in Wroc≈Çaw,
    Poland).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're in need of a specialist in architecture/cloud/dotnet/nodejs, I'd
    love to explore how I can contribute. Feel free to reach out!
